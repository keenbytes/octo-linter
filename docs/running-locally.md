# Running locally

## Syntax
Check below help message for `lint` command:

    Usage:  octo-linter lint [FLAGS]
    
    Runs the linter on files from a specific directory
    
    Required flags: 
      -p,	 --path DIR       Path to .github directory
    
    Optional flags: 
      -c,	 --config FILE    Linter config with rules in YAML format
      -l,	 --loglevel       One of NONE,ERR,WARN,DEBUG
      -s,	 --secrets-file   Check if secret names exist in this file (one per line)
      -z,	 --vars-file      Check if variable names exist in this file (one per line)

Use `-p` argument to point to `.github` directories.  The tool will search for any actions in the `actions`
directory, where each action is in its own sub-directory and its filename is either `action.yaml` or
`action.yml`.  And, it will search for workflows' `*.yml` and `*.yaml` files in `workflows` directory.

Additionally, all the variable names (meaning `${{ var.NAME }}`) as well as secrets (`${{ secret.NAME }}`)
in the workflow can be checked against a list of possible names.  Use `-z` and `-s` arguments with paths
to files containing a list of possible variable or secret names, with names being separated by new line or
space.  Check [Demo](demo.md) for a sample usage.
